# Solar Water Heater Control

This repository contains a Home Assistant automation blueprint to control a water
heater using available solar power. The blueprint evaluates Solcast solar
forecasts, current house consumption and battery state of charge to decide when
it is efficient to heat water. It does not rely on additional template sensors
and can be imported directly into Home Assistant.
